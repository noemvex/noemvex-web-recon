##  About
**NOEMVEX-WEB** is a fast and efficient web reconnaissance tool developed to automate the initial discovery phase of a web application engagement. By leveraging passive certificate transparency logs, it maps out the target's subdomains without ever interacting directly with the secondary assets. Furthermore, it audits HTTP response headers for missing security controls and performs a high-speed multi-threaded scan for sensitive artifacts such as `.env`, `.git`, or backup files that often lead to critical information disclosure.



##  Capabilities
* **Passive Subdomain Enumeration:** Queries `crt.sh` to extract subdomains from SSL/TLS certificate logs, ensuring zero-touch discovery.
* **Security Header Audit:** Analyzes critical headers like CSP, HSTS, and X-Frame-Options to evaluate the target's hardening posture.
* **Sensitive File Discovery:** Multi-threaded fuzzing engine targeting high-value files (.env, wp-config, etc.) and restricted directories.
* **Web Server Identification:** Automatically extracts server banners to assist in version-specific vulnerability research.
* **Smart URL Normalization:** Handles both raw domains and full URLs, ensuring the engine adapts to the input format.
